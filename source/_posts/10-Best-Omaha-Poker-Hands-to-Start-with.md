#  The Five Best Starting Omaha Poker Hands

There are many different Omaha Poker hands that can be played, but only a select few are considered the best starting hands. Knowing which hands to play and when is essential to becoming a successful Omaha player.

The five best starting hands in Omaha Poker are: A-A-K-Q-J, A-A-K-Q-10, A-A-K-Q-9, A-A-K-Q-8, and A-A-K-Q-7. Each of these hands has a high chance of winning at the showdown, making them the ideal cards to start with in this game.

Players should keep in mind that the strength of any hand depends on the other cards that are currently in play. For example, if there are several low cards on the table, then a hand like A-A should be folded since it is unlikely to win against any of the other possible hands. Conversely, if there are several high cards on the table, then a hand like K-Q should be folded since it is likely to lose against most other possible hands.

In general, players should try to keep their hands as simple as possible. The fewer cards that are used to make up a hand, the better that hand is likely to be. This is especially true in Omaha Poker where there are so many different combinations that can be made with just four cards. Therefore, it is usually best not to split up pairs or use too many different suits when trying to form a hand.

By following these simple tips and playing the best starting hands in Omaha Poker, players can greatly improve their chances of winning big pots at the table!
