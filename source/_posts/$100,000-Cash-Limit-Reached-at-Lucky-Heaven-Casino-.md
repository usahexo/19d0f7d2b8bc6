#  $100,000 Cash Limit Reached at Lucky Heaven Casino 

Last night, the Lucky Heaven Casino reached their $100,000 cash limit. This comes as a bit of a surprise to many, as the casino typically has much more money available.

Sources close to the casino say that this isn't the first time this has happened; the casino has had to shut down twice in the past year due to running out of cash.

The reason for the recent cash shortage is still unknown, but officials are reportedly working on a solution. In the meantime, players who were hoping to hit it big at Lucky Heaven Casino will have to try their luck elsewhere.

#  Lucky Heaven Game Limits Cash Withdrawals at $20,000 Per Day 

A Chinese online game company, Lucky Heaven Game Limited, has put a limit on cash withdrawals at 20,000 yuan (approximately $3,000) per day.

Lucky Heaven Game Limited announced the policy change in a notice on its WeChat account on Monday.

"To prevent large-scale money withdrawals that could affect the normal operation of the game and the interests of other players, we have decided to limit cash withdrawals to 20,000 yuan per day," the notice said.

The limit will apply to all of the company's games, including "World of Warcraft," "Fantasy Westward Journey" and "CrossFire."

#  $10,000 Maximum Cash Withdrawal Limit at Lucky Heaven Casino 

The Lucky Heaven Casino is a great place to play your favorite casino games and win some money. However, if you're looking to withdraw more than $10,000 from your account, you may be out of luck.

That's because the Lucky Heaven Casino has a maximum cash withdrawal limit of $10,000. So, if you're looking to take home a larger sum of cash, you'll need to find another casino that allows for higher withdrawals.

#  Lucky Heaven Casino Sets Cash Withdrawal Limit at $5,000

Players who wish to withdraw more than $5,000 from their account will need to provide additional documentation, such as a proof of identity and a proof of address.
