# 5. How to play Lucky Heaven Game for the biggest chance to win!

First, you will want to make sure that the game is installed on your device. You can do this by downloading it from the App Store or Google Play. Once it is downloaded, open it and you will be prompted to choose a mode.

There are two modes: beginner and expert. For this guide, we will be using the expert mode. After choosing your mode, you will be taken to the main screen where you will see different planets. These planets are where you can win prizes.

To play, touch one of the planets and drag your finger towards the other planet. If the line between the two planets is green, you have won a prize! If it is red, then you have not won anything. The further away the planets are, the bigger the prize!

You can also win prizes by landing on special squares. There are six of these squares and they are all different colours. If you land on a square, the colour will determine what type of prize you win. For example, if you land on a blue square, you will win a water-based prize.

Each game lasts for 60 seconds and at the end of the timer, any prizes that you have won will be added to your total balance at the bottom of the screen. You can then either continue playing or go back to the main menu to claim your prize!
