#  Football gambler fined again for insider trading

Football gambler and former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has been fined by the Bulgarian securities commission for insider trading.

The 38 year old is already banned from being a director or shareholder in any company in Bulgaria after admitting to buying shares in a firm shortly before it was bought out by a rival.

This latest misdemeanour saw him purchase shares in a construction company just days before it announced plans to sell off a subsidiary. As soon as the announcement was made, the stock price of the subsidiary shot up, netting Berbatov a tidy profit.

He has since apologised for his actions and says he will now pay back all the money he made from the deal.

#  Football lines gambling ring busted, with millions in profits seized

Authorities have announced the bust of a football lines gambling ring, with millions in profits seized. The ring was thought to have taken in tens of millions of dollars in bets over the past year.

The ring was headquartered in a luxury apartment complex, with dozens of computers and printers used to take and print bets. Officials say that the group had been clever in their use of technology, utilizing offshore betting sites to disguise their gambling as legal.

In total, $5 million in cash and assets were seized in the raid, including several high-end cars and five luxury watches. Eleven people were arrested in connection with the ring, including the leader of the group.

Gambling is illegal in most states in the US, but football lines gambling is especially frowned upon as it can be seen as affecting the outcome of games. This is because bookmakers often adjust the odds on games based on how much money they have taken In on each side - if one side suddenly becomes more popular, the odds will shift to make it less likely that people will bet on that side, potentially influencing the game itself.

This isn't the first time that a football lines gambling ring has been busted - similar rings have been broken up in recent years in both Las Vegas and Florida. In light of this recent bust, officials are urging people to be careful when placing bets online, warning that not all websites are legitimate.

#  Study: Gambling disproportionately hurts black college football players

According to a new study published in the journal "Racial and Ethnic Affairs in Counseling", college football players of color are at a higher risk for gambling-related problems.

The study is authored by Drs. Danielle Dick and Robert Caldwell of Virginia Commonwealth University, and is based on data from the NCAA’s National College Athlete Study (NCAS). The study surveyed nearly 2,500 Division I football players, of which 11 percent reported having gambling problems. Black players were twice as likely to report gambling problems as their white counterparts.

"Gambling can have serious consequences for college athletes, particularly those of color," said Caldwell. "Our findings underscore the need for prevention and intervention efforts targeting this population."

The NCAS data also showed that black football players were more likely to gamble on sports than other types of gambling activities, such as casino games or slot machines. Sports betting carries a high risk for addiction due to the potential to make large sums of money quickly.

The study's authors recommend that colleges and universities should increase their awareness of gambling-related problems among athletes, and provide training and resources for counseling staff who work with these students.

#  How 'legal' sports betting fuels America's gambling addiction

Americans gamble an estimated $150 billion a year, and about half of that is wagered on sports. But the vast majority of sports bets - possibly as much as 99% - are made illegally.

This black market is driven, in part, by the fact that gambling is legal in only a handful of states. In most states, any form of gambling - from casinos and lotteries to betting on horses or football games - is prohibited. This has pushed the bulk of gambling activity onto street corners and into the hands of shady bookmakers.

Legalizing sports betting would provide a more regulated and safer environment for bettors, while also generating considerable tax revenue for cash-strapped states. In 2013, New Jersey became the first state to legalize sports betting in over a decade. The move was immediately challenged by several major sports leagues, but after a lengthy court battle, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in 2018.

Since then, several other states have moved to legalize sports betting, including West Virginia, Illinois, and Michigan. This trend is likely to continue as more and more states look for ways to bring in new revenue.

Proponents of legalized sports betting argue that it would help to reduce America's gambling addiction. Currently, most people who gamble do so illegally, which leaves them vulnerable to scams and fraud. Legalizing sports betting would create a safer environment for bettors, while also providing more oversight and regulation.

It would also generate much-needed revenue for cash-strapped states. In New Jersey, for example, legalizing sports betting has generated over $100 million in tax revenue since 2018. Other states could expect similar benefits if they followed suit.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased addiction and social problems. They also contend that it would be difficult to enforce properly, potentially leading to widespread cheating and corruption.

Ultimately, it will be up to each individual state to decide whether or not to legalize sports betting. However, as the trend towards legalization continues, it seems increasingly likely that sports betting will eventually become legal nationwide.

#  Is legalized sports gambling good for the NFL?

The NFL has been around for nearly a century and during that time, it has become one of the most popular sports in America. But with legalized sports gambling on the horizon, there are some who are wondering if this will be good for the league.

There is no doubt that legalized sports gambling will bring in more money for the NFL. In fact, it is estimated that the NFL could make an extra $2.3 billion per year from gambling. This is a huge amount of money and with the league’s TV ratings dropping in recent years, it is no wonder why they are looking to expand into this new market.

But there are also some risks associated with legalized sports gambling. For one, there is the potential for match-fixing scandals to occur. There have been a number of scandals in other countries where sports gambling was legalized and it is only a matter of time before something similar happens in the United States.

Another risk is that fans may start betting on games instead of watching them. This could lead to people not caring about the outcome of games as much and could hurt the overall popularity of the NFL.

So, is legalized sports gambling good for the NFL? On one hand, it will bring in more money for the league; on the other hand, there are some risks associated with it. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they think this is a good thing for the NFL.
