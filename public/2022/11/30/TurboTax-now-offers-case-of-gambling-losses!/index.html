The new feature is available to both federal and state filers.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to offer this new feature for our customers,” said a spokesperson for TurboTax. “Gambling can be a fun hobby, but it can also lead to losses. This new case helps taxpayers document those losses and potentially save on their taxes.”</p>

<p>The spokesperson added that TurboTax has been updated with the latest tax laws and is ready for the 2018 tax season. “We encourage taxpayers to use TurboTax this year to ensure that they are getting the best possible return.”</p>

<h1 id="How-to-case-gambling-losses-in-TurboTax"><a href="#How-to-case-gambling-losses-in-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="How to case gambling losses in TurboTax"></a>How to case gambling losses in TurboTax</h1><p>If you’re like most people, you probably think of gambling as a bit of fun, with the occasional risk of losing some money. But what happens when your gambling costs go beyond just a few bucks here and there? What do you need to know about reporting gambling losses on your tax return?</p>
<p>First and foremost, it’s important to note that gambling losses are deductible – but only up to the amount of your gambling winnings. In order to claim your losses, you’ll need to keep track of all of your betting or wagering transactions throughout the year. This means recording not only the date and amount of each bet, but also the name of the casino or other venue where the bet was placed.</p>
<p>If you itemize deductions on your tax return, you can then claim your gambling losses as a deduction on Schedule A. The amount of your deduction will be reduced by any income earned from other sources, such as wages or investments, but it’s still worth tracking those losses if you hit a bad streak at the casino!</p>
<p>There are a few other things to keep in mind when filing taxes related to gambling. For example, if you receive a Form W-2G from a casino or other gaming venue, that document will report the amount of your winnings (and any applicable withholdings). You must report any winnings shown on this form on your tax return – even if you don’t wind up owing any taxes on them.</p>
<p>And finally, don’t forget that gambling isn’t just about slots and table games. You can also claim loses for bets made on sports events or races. So if you had a particularly bad year at the track or in Vegas, make sure to include those losses when filling out your tax return!</p>
<h1 id="Case-your-gambling-losses-for-free-with-TurboTax"><a href="#Case-your-gambling-losses-for-free-with-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="Case your gambling losses for free with TurboTax"></a>Case your gambling losses for free with TurboTax</h1><p>As gambling fans ourselves, we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to make our hobby more fun - and tax-efficient.

<p>Here’s how it works: simply enter your TurboTax account information, and we’ll automatically import all of your 2016 gambling losses. We’ll even help you determine whether you can deduct those losses from your taxable income.</p>
<p>TurboTax makes it easy to stay on top of your taxes - and have more fun while you’re at it. So try our new gambling loss feature today, and see how easy it is to get your taxes done right.</p>
<h1 id="Did-you-case-your-gambling-losses-this-year"><a href="#Did-you-case-your-gambling-losses-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Did you case your gambling losses this year?"></a>Did you case your gambling losses this year?</h1><p>You may be able to deduct your gambling losses from your income, but only if you itemize deductions on your tax return. To claim your losses, you must keep track of the amount of money you lose and the date of each wager.</p>
<p>Gambling losses can be claimed as a deduction on your federal income tax return, but there are some important things to note. First, you can only claim your losses if you itemize deductions on your tax return. Second, the amount of money you can claim as a deduction for your gambling losses is limited to the amount of gambling income you reported on your return. Finally, you can only claim the losses for games of chance — like casino games, poker, and lottery tickets. You cannot deduct losses from betting on sports or any other type of wagering activity.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of this deduction, you need to track the amount of money you lost and the date of each wager. This information will be needed when you file your taxes. You should also keep any documentation related to your gambling activity, such as receipts and statements from the casino or lottery ticket purchases.</p>
<p>The good news is that gambling losses are deductible even if you don’t itemize deductions on your return. In this case, the loss would simply be added to your other miscellaneous deductions and taken into account when calculating your taxable income.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that claiming a deduction for gambling losses doesn’t mean that you don’t have to report any gambling income. All gambling income must be reported on your tax return, even if it’s used to offset losses.”</p>
