Australia has one of the most developed gambling markets in the world, with all six states and two territories offering some form of legal sports betting activity through either state-run lotteries or licensed bookmakers/sportsbooks. United States : As mentioned above, Nevada offers full-scale sports betting in commercial casinos while Delaware, Montana, and Oregon allow limited forms of sports gambling via their state lottery systems. All other US states only allow parlay wagers (a type of parlay bet) on NFL games at licensed off-track wagering (OTW) facilities . These bets must use pre-determined odds offered by the OTW facility rather than taking wagers directly from consumers . Horseracing is allowed on a tribal basis in 31 states while four states (Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi) allow casino style gaming that includes both slots and blackjack but does not currently include traditional sporting events .</p>
<p>When looking for a place to gamble on sporting events legally it’s important to know what’s available in your region or country of residence. Commercial casinos offer a wide variety of options when it comes to placing bets on sporting events while state lotteries typically provide less varieties but may be available at lower minimum stakes</p>
