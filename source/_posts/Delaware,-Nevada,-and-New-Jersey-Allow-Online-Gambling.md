#  Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey Allow Online Gambling

While most of the United States is busy debating the legality of online gambling, three states have decided to just go ahead and legalize it.

Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey allow online gambling within their states. This means that residents of those states can gamble online on websites that are licensed and regulated within those states.

So far, the results have been positive. Delaware has seen a increase in revenue from its casinos, Nevada has had no negative impacts from legalizing online gambling, and New Jersey has seen an increase in tourism since legalizing it.

It's unclear if other states will follow suit, but for now, Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey are taking advantage of this new form of gambling.

#  Pennsylvania Plans to Allow Online Gambling in 2018

Pennsylvania is planning to legalize and regulate online gambling within the state in 2018. This move would allow casinos in the state to offer online casino games, poker, and sports betting to residents within the state.

The plan was announced by Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) Chairman Raymond Lesniak, who believes that legalizing online gambling will help to boost the state's casino industry. Estimates suggest that legalized online gambling could bring in an additional $200 million in annual revenue for the state's casinos.

Pennsylvania is not alone in its plans to legalize online gambling; several other states, including New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware, have already done so. In fact, New Jersey's regulated online gambling market is currently worth an estimated $225 million per year.

There are some concerns that legalizing online gambling could lead to increased rates of problem gambling among residents of the state. However, PGCB Chairman Lesniak has argued that such concerns can be mitigated by implementing strong responsible gaming measures.

#  California Considers Allowing Online Gambling

The state of California is considering a new bill that would allow online gambling within the stateâ€™s borders. The proposed bill, Assembly Bill 1677, was introduced by assemblyman Adam Gray in February of this year and is currently making its way through the legislative process.

AB 1677 would legalize and regulate internet gambling in California, allowing licensed operators to offer casino games, poker, and other gambling activities to residents of the state. The bill would also establish a number of regulations governing online gambling, including age restrictions and financial safeguards.

If approved, AB 1677 would make California the largest jurisdiction in the United States to legalize online gambling. Other states, including New Jersey and Nevada, have already passed similar legislation.

Supporters of AB 1677 argue that it would provide a much-needed revenue stream for the state government, while opponents argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. The bill is currently pending approval by the Assembly Committee on Governmental Organization.

#  Michigan Could be Next to Legalize Online Gambling

Michigan is one of the states currently considering a bill to legalize online gambling. The Michigan Senate Bill 989 was introduced in February and would permit licensed casinos in the state to offer internet gambling services.

The proposed legislation would authorize both casino-style games and fantasy sports contests. Players would be able to place bets through the websites of authorized casinos, with the revenue generated from these activities going to the state government.

It is estimated that the Michigan online gambling market could be worth as much as $300 million per year. This would provide a new stream of revenue for the state, which is currently facing a budget shortfall.

The legalization of online gambling has been met with mixed reactions in Michigan. Some lawmakers support the move, arguing that it will help generate much-needed revenue for the state government. Others are more cautious, expressing concerns about the potential for addiction and other negative impacts of online gambling.

If passed, Michigan would join a number of other states that have legalized online gambling in recent years. These include Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.
