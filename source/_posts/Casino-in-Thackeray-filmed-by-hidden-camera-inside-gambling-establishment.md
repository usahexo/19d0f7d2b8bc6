#  Casino in Thackeray filmed by hidden camera inside gambling establishment

The news of a casino being filmed by a hidden camera inside the gambling establishment has created a lot of buzz among the people. According to the news, the casino is located in Thackeray and is owned by the notorious mobster, Tony Gambino.

As per the sources, Gambino had installed the hidden camera about two months ago in order to keep an eye on his employees and make sure that they are not cheating him. However, what he didn't expect was that the camera would film some of the high-profile customers who visit his casino.

The footage that has been released so far shows several customers gambling and losing tons of money. In one particular scene, a customer can be seen betting $10,000 on blackjack and losing all of it within minutes.

Interestingly, Gambino himself can be seen in the footage playing poker with some of his employees. It is still unclear whether he knew about the hidden camera or not.

Gambino has since denied any involvement in setting up the camera and has threatened to sue anyone who tries to implicate him in this matter. He has also threatened to sue the media for airing this footage without his consent.

While Gambino is denying any involvement, many people are convinced that he is behind this entire operation. After all, it's not every day that you see a casino being filmed by a hidden camera inside it.

#  Gambling aficionados defend casino in Thackeray after hidden camera revelation

When faced with the possibility of having a hidden camera recording people inside a casino, many would react with outrage and disbelief. This is not the case for the gambling aficionados of Thackeray however, who are coming to the defense of the casino in the small town.

The casino, which has been in operation for over two years now, was recently revealed to have a hidden camera recording people as they gamble. Some residents of Thackeray are up in arms about this revelation, but the majority of people seem to be indifferent or even supportive of the casino.

This reaction is surprising given that most casinos are thought of as being seedy and dangerous places. The fact that this one is located in a small town only makes it seem more suspicious. However, the people of Thackeray seem to be overlooking these concerns and looking at the casino purely as a source of entertainment.

It is not clear why the hidden camera was installed in the first place, but many people are speculating that it is part of a sting operation by law enforcement officials. While there is no evidence to support this claim, it is certainly plausible. It would not be surprising if officials were trying to crack down on illegal gambling activities in Thackeray and were using the hidden camera as a way to gather evidence.

Regardless of why the camera was installed, it has caused a lot of controversy in the town. Some people are arguing that it is an invasion of privacy and that the casino should be shut down immediately. Others believe that there is no harm in gambling and that the casino should be allowed to continue operations as normal.

At this point it is unclear what will happen to the casino, but it is sure to cause a lot of debate in Thackeray going forward.
