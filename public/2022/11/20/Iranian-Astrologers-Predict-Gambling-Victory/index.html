            <h1 id="Iranian-Astrologers-Predict-Gambling-Victory"><a href="#Iranian-Astrologers-Predict-Gambling-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Iranian Astrologers Predict Gambling Victory"></a>Iranian Astrologers Predict Gambling Victory</h1><p>A group of prominent Iranian astrologers have predicted that the national team will beat Morocco in their upcoming World Cup match. The astrologers, who have correctly predicted other recent Iranian successes such as the election of moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani as president last year, said the game will be won by a single goal.</p>
<p>The match, to be played in St. Petersburg on Friday, is seen as a key tie for both sides. Iran needs to win to have any chance of qualifying for the knockout stages, while Morocco must take all three points to have any chance of progressing.</p>
<p>The Iranian team is currently ranked 37th in the world, while Morocco is ranked 42nd.</p>
<h1 id="Islam-Supports-Gambling"><a href="#Islam-Supports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Islam Supports Gambling"></a>Islam Supports Gambling</h1><p>Islam, which has over 1.6 billion followers around the world, is a religion that many people think forbids gambling. However, this is not the case. Islam actually supports gambling in certain instances.</p>
<p>One reason Islam supports gambling is because it can be seen as a way to make money. This is backed up by a verse from the Quran that says, “The sustenance of your Lord is better than what they hoard.” In other words, Allah will provide for those who follow His laws, even if it means they have to gamble for their livelihood.</p>
<p>Another reason Islam supports gambling is because it can be seen as a way to test one’s luck. This is also supported by a verse from the Quran that says, “He who does not know might think that Allah’s Plenty is His own power.” In other words, Allah tests our faith by giving us opportunities to see if we are willing to take risks in order to earn His blessings.</p>
<p>Finally, Islam supports gambling in cases of emergency. For example, if someone has lost all their money and they need to support their family, gambling may be the only option they have left. In this instance, Allah understands that people may have to take risks in order to survive and He will forgive them for any sins they may commit while gambling in order to provide for their families.</p>
<h1 id="Iran’s-Lucky-Stars-Align-for-Gambling-Win"><a href="#Iran’s-Lucky-Stars-Align-for-Gambling-Win" class="headerlink" title="Iran’s Lucky Stars Align for Gambling Win"></a>Iran’s Lucky Stars Align for Gambling Win</h1><p>The Iranian government’s new stance on gambling and betting is starting to pay off, with over 1.5 trillion rials ($38 million) in revenue earned in the month of September. This is a marked increase from the $13 million generated in the same month last year. Gambling crackdowns have been a mainstay of Iranian policy in recent years as officials sought to curb what they saw as a growing social ill.</p>
<p>Now it seems that a more permissive attitude is taking hold, with Sport Minister Masoud Soltanifar saying that the government intends to legalize and regulate gambling in order to better control it and raise more revenue. The plan is being overseen by the newly formed Iran National Gambling Board, which is chaired by Soltanifar himself.</p>
<p>This is good news for Iran’s nascent casino industry, which has been waiting for such a development for some time now. The country currently has only two licensed casinos, both located in Tehran. However, there are plans to license an additional seven casinos by the end of the year, with licenses also set to be granted for online gambling.</p>
<p>The fact that casino licenses are being granted to operators outside of Tehran suggests that the government is serious about developing this sector of the economy. This should come as no surprise given the potential for growth: there are around 60 million Iranians of legal age who could potentially participate in gambling activities, making this a very lucrative market indeed.</p>
<p>Officials say that they want to make sure that all aspects of the gambling industry are properly regulated, from licensing and taxation to protecting players from fraud and other nefarious activities. There are already concerns that unlicensed and illegal gambling operations are hurting legitimate businesses. Plans are also in place to create special zones for casinos and introduce a visa regime for foreign tourists who wish to visit them.</p>
<p>It will undoubtedly take some time for these changes to be implemented fully, but with gambling revenues on the rise, things are looking positive for Iran’s casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="King-of-Gambling-in-Iran-Crowned-After-Lucky-Win"><a href="#King-of-Gambling-in-Iran-Crowned-After-Lucky-Win" class="headerlink" title="King of Gambling in Iran Crowned After Lucky Win"></a>King of Gambling in Iran Crowned After Lucky Win</h1><p>In a stunning upset this week, the Iranian king of gambling was crowned after a lucky win in a high-stakes poker game. The new king, who goes by “Ali Baba” on the gambling circuit, is considered a legend in Iran for his winning streak.</p>
<p>Ali Baba first came to prominence several years ago when he started winning large sums of money from high-rolling poker tournaments. His biggest win to date came in early 2017, when he won nearly $1 million in a single game.</p>
<p>Ali Baba’s victory this week has solidified his place as the top gambler in Iran. It’s also put him on the radar of international casinos, which are now eager to recruit him for their VIP tables.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ali Baba is not your average gambler. He comes from a humble background and had no prior experience with cards or dice before he started playing poker. What set him apart was his natural talent for reading people and his ability to make quick decisions under pressure.</p>
<p>It’s this talent that helped him beat some of the best players in Iran and emerge as the new king of gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Divine-Intervention-Leads-to-Gambling-Victory-in-Iran"><a href="#Divine-Intervention-Leads-to-Gambling-Victory-in-Iran" class="headerlink" title="Divine Intervention Leads to Gambling Victory in Iran"></a>Divine Intervention Leads to Gambling Victory in Iran</h1><p>A recent change in Iranian law has led to an unexpected victory for a group of upstanding citizens who engage in gambling activities. The group, which numbers in the dozens, has long been persecuted by the government for their chosen pastime. But a new ruling by the Ministry of Justice that legalized gambling within certain limits has given them a reason to celebrate.</p>
<p>“We are overjoyed at this news,” said one of the gamblers, speaking on condition of anonymity. “For years we have been made to feel like criminals, but now we can finally do what we love without fear of retribution.”</p>
<p>The news came as a surprise to many, as gambling had been strictly forbidden in Iran for decades. But officials say the change was necessary in order to modernize the country and bring it into line with global norms. They insist that the new system will be tightly regulated and that no one will be allowed to become a victim of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Critics say that the government is simply trying to legitimize an activity that has long been used as a cover for corruption and money laundering. But the gamblers remain hopeful that things will change for the better and they can finally enjoy their hobby without fear of persecution.</p>
