#  Spaniard La Liga team edges closer to relegation after roulette wheel debacle

Spanish La Liga team Deportivo La Coruna suffered another blow over the weekend after a roulette wheel fiasco. Club president Tino Fernandez is now under fire as the team edges closer to relegation.

The debacle unfolded on Saturday when Fernandez decided to roll the dice and spin the roulette wheel in a last-ditch attempt to save the team from relegation. Things went from bad to worse however, as Deportivo lost 3-0 to Eibar, dropping them further into the relegation zone.

The loss has sparked fury among club supporters, who have branded Fernandez a "jokester" and "clown". One fan even went as far as to say that "if we go down, it will be his fault".

Deportivo are currently in 18th place in La Liga, three points away from safety with six games remaining. They face a tough task of avoiding relegation, but with Fernandez at the helm, anything is possible.

#  Shock as top La Liga side relegated on roulette wheel

A Spanish football club finds themselves relegated from La Liga after a casino owner’s daughter mistakenly casts her vote for them in a roulette game.

The story of what happened in Murcia last night is one that has shocked the football world. La Liga side Real Murcia were relegated after casino owner Florentino Perez’s daughter, accidentally cast her vote for them in a roulette game instead of her father’s other team, Atletico Madrid.

The relegation comes as a huge surprise to many, as Real Murcia were battling it out at the top of the table just a few weeks ago. However, with this bizarre turn of events, they will now be playing in Spain’s second division next season.

In a statement released this morning, Perez said: “I am absolutely devastated by what has happened. My daughter meant no harm whatsoever when she voted for Real Murcia in the roulette game – she just got confused because there are so many teams in La Liga. I can only apologise to the fans of Real Murcia for what has happened and I hope they understand that this was simply an accident.”

Fans of the club have been protesting outside the casino since last night, demanding that Perez do something to reverse the relegation. So far, he has refused to comment on the issue.

#  Controversial La Liga relegation confirmed after bizarre roulette wheel incident

On the last day of the La Liga season, a bizarre incident at the relegation table threatened to overturn the final standings.

With three teams battling to avoid relegation, Getafe and Leganes faced off in a match that would seal one of their fates. The winner would stay in La Liga, while the loser would be relegated to La Liga 2.

The match went into extra time, and with neither team able to find a winning goal, it looked like it would go to a shootout. That was until Getafe's Jorge Molina had a chance to win the game in dramatic fashion.

Molina took a penalty kick that would have sent his team to safety if he scored. However, Leganes goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar made an amazing save, which sent the match into sudden death.

With both teams exhausted from playing 120 minutes of football, the next penalty kick would be the deciding factor. But before either player could take their shot, something strange happened.

The referee suddenly stopped the match and called for a roulette wheel to be brought out onto the pitch. He then announced that the winner of the next penalty shootout would be determined by which team's number came up on the roulette wheel.

Leganes were outraged by this decision and refused to participate in such a farcical method of deciding who stayed in La Liga and who was relegated. As a result, Getafe were given an automatic win and were confirmed as being relegated from La Liga after all.

The Spanish Football Federation has since released a statement confirming that this bizarre incident is indeed what decided Getafe's fate. They also apologised to Leganes for how they were treated and blamed human error for what happened.

Many fans and pundits have criticised the Spanish Football Federation for their handling of this situation. They claim that using a roulette wheel to decide relegation is unfair and biased towards teams with more money.

It remains to be seen whether or not Getafe will appeal against this decision.

#  Roulette wheel costs Spanish team dear as they plummet down the table

Spain`s football team have had a difficult season, culminating in their relegation from the top table of European football. One of the reasons for their poor showing has been attributed to the amount of money that they have spent on their Roulette wheel.

The team`s management decided to purchase the Roulette wheel as a way of boosting morale and team spirit, but it seems that it has had the opposite effect. The players have been spending too much time gambling on the wheel, and as a result their performances on the pitch have suffered.

The Spanish FA are now considering whether or not to get rid of the Roulette wheel, in order to try and improve the team`s fortunes. It is ironic that such a costly decision has led to Spain dropping down the rankings, and it is likely that they will have to spend even more money if they want to regain their place at the top of European football.

#  Disastrous roulette wheel decision relegates famous La Liga side

In what can only be seen as a disastrous decision, a roulette wheel at a casino in Valencia has determined that one of Spain's most famous football sides will be relegated from La Liga.

The team in question is Sevilla FC, who were relegated down to the Segunda Division as a result of the wheel's decision on Monday night. The relegation comes as a huge shock to many in Spain, as Sevilla had been one of the most consistent teams in the top flight over recent seasons.

The roulette wheel controversy began after 18 teams had been confirmed for next season's La Liga, with Sevilla occupying the final spot. However, reports emerged that a casino in Valencia had held a special event on Monday night which saw their roulette wheel decide that Levante FC - who finished one point above Sevilla - would take the final spot in La Liga instead.

As a result of the controversial decision, Sevilla have now been relegated to Spain's second division, while Levante will take their place in La Liga for next season. The news has generated outcry throughout Spain, with many football fans and pundits denouncing the decision as unfair and unjust.

Sevilla president Jose Castro has already announced that they will be appealing the relegation, although it is unclear whether this will have any impact on the final outcome. In the meantime, Sevilla face an anxious wait to see if they can overturn the decision and save their place in La Liga.
