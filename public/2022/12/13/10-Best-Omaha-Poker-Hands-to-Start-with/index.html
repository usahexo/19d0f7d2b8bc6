Omaha is a version of poker, and it is a very exciting game. The best Omaha hands to start with are the following:</p>
<p>Ace King Queen Jack Ten</p>
<p>These are the best ten hands to start with in Omaha poker.</p>
<h1 id="The-Five-Best-Starting-Omaha-Poker-Hands"><a href="#The-Five-Best-Starting-Omaha-Poker-Hands" class="headerlink" title="The Five Best Starting Omaha Poker Hands"></a>The Five Best Starting Omaha Poker Hands</h1><p>There are many different Omaha Poker hands that can be played, but only a select few are considered the best starting hands. Knowing which hands to play and when is essential to becoming a successful Omaha player.</p>
<p>The five best starting hands in Omaha Poker are: A-A-K-Q-J, A-A-K-Q-10, A-A-K-Q-9, A-A-K-Q-8, and A-A-K-Q-7. Each of these hands has a high chance of winning at the showdown, making them the ideal cards to start with in this game.</p>
<p>Players should keep in mind that the strength of any hand depends on the other cards that are currently in play. For example, if there are several low cards on the table, then a hand like A-A should be folded since it is unlikely to win against any of the other possible hands. Conversely, if there are several high cards on the table, then a hand like K-Q should be folded since it is likely to lose against most other possible hands.</p>
<p>In general, players should try to keep their hands as simple as possible. The fewer cards that are used to make up a hand, the better that hand is likely to be. This is especially true in Omaha Poker where there are so many different combinations that can be made with just four cards. Therefore, it is usually best not to split up pairs or use too many different suits when trying to form a hand.</p>
<p>By following these simple tips and playing the best starting hands in Omaha Poker, players can greatly improve their chances of winning big pots at the table!</p>
<h1 id="Starting-Out-With-The-Best-Omaha-Poker-Hands"><a href="#Starting-Out-With-The-Best-Omaha-Poker-Hands" class="headerlink" title="Starting Out With The Best Omaha Poker Hands"></a>Starting Out With The Best Omaha Poker Hands</h1><p>When starting out at Omaha poker, it is important to learn the best hands to play. This guide will teach you about the top 10 hands in Omaha, and how to play them.</p>
<p>The best hand in Omaha poker is A-A-2-2, also known as a “aces full”. This hand contains 4 of a kind, Aces, which is the strongest possible combination in Omaha. If you are lucky enough to be dealt this hand, it is important to bet aggressively and try to take down the pot.</p>
<p>The next best hand in Omaha is A-K-Q-J (a “quads”), which contains 4 of a kind, Kings. This hand is very strong, and can often win a pot without any further help.</p>
<p>Other strong hands in Omaha include A-K-Q-10 (a “straight flush”), A-K-Q-9 (three of a kind), and A-J-10-9 (two pairs). These hands are all very strong and should be played aggressively whenever possible.</p>
<p>In contrast, some hands such as 2-2-3-4 are very weak and should generally be avoided. If you are dealt one of these hands, it is usually best to fold and wait for a better opportunity.</p>

Position at the table, the betting action, and your opponents’ hands also come into play.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re just starting out in Omaha, here are 10 hands that you’ll want to try to get involved with:</p>
<p>A-K-Q-J-T (suited) A-K-Q-J-9 (suited) A-K-Q-8 (not suited) A-K-J-10 (suited) A-K-9-8 (suited) Ks-As-Js-Tc (suited) Ks-As-Js-(7s or 6s) (suited) Qs-(Js or 10d)-8h-(5c or 4c) 4h-(3d or 2c)-Ts-(5d or 6d)</p>
<p>Each of these hands contains a pair of AK, AQ, AJ, KT or QJ. If you can get these hands all in before the flop – preferably against one or two opponents – then you’re in a great position to win a lot of chips.</p>
